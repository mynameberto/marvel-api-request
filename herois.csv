1011482|Hela|Hela was born ages ago to the being who would one day be called Odin and a goddess whose name and image have been lost in antiquity. On the day of her maturity, Odin appointed her goddess and ruler of the northernmost realms of the dead. Her special dominion was over the souls of all who did not die in battle, while Odin himself built the palace Valhalla to house the souls of all of those who died as heroes. In recent years, when Odin&rsquo;s attention had strayed from the maintenance of Valhalla, Hela tried to annex that realm to her own, hoping to consolidate her power over all Asgard&rsquo;s dead. Eventually Odin grew aware of her ambitions and opposed them. In the course of battle, Odin&rsquo;s band of Valkyries, the custodians of Valhalla, lost their physical forms, no longer able to travel from Valhalla except in their wraith-like astral forms. Hela gave up her contest for Valhalla when Odin vowed to keep better watch over it in future, and she returned to her realms.|62|30|75|5

1016839|Iron Fist (USM)|"Danny is always focused yet relaxed - more Zen-focused than chill surfer dude. But when Danny turns into Iron First, he becomes very rigid with perfect posture. A very Yin/Yang character. 

Danny is THE Danny Rand â€“ the 17-year-old head of the giant Rand Corporation.  His wealth rivals Osbornâ€™s â€“ but youâ€™d never know it from his laid- back attitude. However, as Iron Fist, he takes his powers very seriously. 

While Danny and Luke are best friends, Danny has a special respect for Spider-Man, acting as a non-judgmental moral commentator on all of Spider-Manâ€™s actions. "|0|0|0|0

The hyperactive loose cannon of the group. Sam always feels like he has something to prove.

Samâ€™s powers derive from the Nova Force, which is channeled through his helmet. These powers include flight, enhanced durability, and the ability to absorb and release pulses of energy. However, Sam does not know the extent of his powers, let alone how they work.  

Enthusiastic and immature, Samâ€™s eagerness can be a blessing and a curse. His personality will constantly clash with Spideyâ€™s as they compete for bragging rights. "|0|0|0|0

Lukeâ€™s unbreakable skin and super strength make him the bruiser out of all the trainees. Heâ€™s the first guy to jump into a fight. However, he can still be hurt by concussive blasts and other forms of energy.

As Dannyâ€™s best friend, Luke is the translator for Dannyâ€™s sometimes spacey, non-sequitur comments. Luke will always be the first to defend Peter from others, both as civilians and Super Heroes."|0|0|0|0

Possessed of evil intelligence and vast power, Surtur was one of the major elemental forces of evil that the Asgardians feared. He was a mystical being whose existence predated that of Odin himself. Over 1,000 feet tall and wielding a huge fiery sword, he was once imprisoned by Odin at the Earth's core. Along with Ymir the Frost Giant and the Midgard Serpent, Surtur was the most powerful of Asgard's native enemies.

Surtur has been freed from imprisonment a few times over the years. The first time the Asgardian god of mischief Loki set Surtur free to wreak havok on Earth. The second time Surtur was set free by Marduk of the Sons of Satannish, a cult of human demon-worshippers. Surtur was banished to some unnamed netherworld at the end of that encounter. He appeared, yet again, in what was to be one of the Asgardians greatest battles against Surtur. Surtur hatched a plan to lure Asgard's armies to Earth leaving the city vulnerable to attack. He crossed Bifrost with his newly forged Twilight blade believing Asgard to be defenseless; Odin, Thor and Loki were there to make a last stand to defeat Surtur. Their victory did not come easy though, as Odin fell along with Surtur into a dimensional rift.

Surtur apparently died along with the Asgardians during Ragnarok."|15|8|20|2
